# About this Manual

This document provides north bound interface details for Link aggregation control protocol feature.

# Scope

This document covers the "show" commands supported for Link aggregation control protocol feature based on openconfig-lacp yang and Unit test cases. It does not include the protocol design or protocol implementation details.

# 1 Feature Overview

Provide CLI, GNMI and REST management framework capabilities for GET support for the existing SONiC implementation of LACP feature.


## 1.1 Requirements

### 1.1.1 Functional Requirements

Provide "show" commands for:

1) LACP portchannel

2) Portchannel members


### 1.1.2 Configuration and Management Requirements

Supported "show" Commands via:
- IS-CLI style show commands
- REST API support
- gNMI Support

Configuration of LACP using management framework is **not supported** due to the following limitations:

- No support for LACP protocol-specific configurations in SONiC. For example, on creating port channels and adding members to it, “teammgrd” daemon (in SONIC code base):
1.	Reads user configuration from CONFIG DB
2.	Spawns an instance of libteamd (open source package for LACP protocol stack) with the given user configurations and a couple of default LACP options.

Now to support protocol specific configurations (LACP interval, LACP mode, Priority, MAC ) we would need to enhance:
1.	REDIS CONFIG DB PORTCHANNEL Table schema
2.	Code changes in “teammgrd” to read these protocol specific configs and to use “teamdctl” control utility to configure the above-mentioned configs to an already running "teamd" daemon.

- `teamd` supports only a few options (not LACP-specific) to be configured via `teamdctl` utility. This could be overcome by enhancing `teamd` to support configuration of LACP parameters.

Due to the above mentioned reasons, LACP **configuration is not supported** in the initial release.

### 3.6.2 CLI
#### 3.6.2.1 Configuration Commands
N/A

#### 3.6.2.2 Show Commands

1) Show LACP system priority
```
   sonic# show lacp system-priority
```
2) Show LACP information about all EtherChannels
```
   sonic# show lacp port-channel
```
3) Show LACP information about a specific EtherChannel
```
   sonic# show lacp port-channel interface port-channel < port-channel id >
```

#### 3.6.2.3 Debug Commands
#### 3.6.2.4 IS-CLI Compliance
The following table maps SONIC CLI commands to corresponding IS-CLI commands. The compliance column identifies how the command comply to the IS-CLI syntax:

- **IS-CLI drop-in replace**  – meaning that it follows exactly the format of a pre-existing IS-CLI command.
- **IS-CLI-like**  – meaning that the exact format of the IS-CLI command could not be followed, but the command is similar to other commands for IS-CLI (e.g. IS-CLI may not offer the exact option, but the command can be positioned is a similar manner as others for the related feature).
- **SONIC** - meaning that no IS-CLI-like command could be found, so the command is derived specifically for SONIC.

|CLI Command|Compliance|IS-CLI Command (if applicable)| Link to the web site identifying the IS-CLI command (if applicable)|
|:---:|:-----------:|:------------------:|-----------------------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Deviations from IS-CLI:**

`show lacp system-priority` is IS-CLI-like because in openconfig-lacp yang, there's no leaf/attribute for global MAC address.


### 3.6.3 REST API Support
**GET**

GET is supported using the following openconfig lacp yang objects.

- `/openconfig-lacp:lacp/state/system-priority`
- `/openconfig-lacp:lacp/interfaces`
- `/openconfig-lacp:lacp/interfaces/interface={name}/state`

# 9 Unit Test
The following lists the unit test cases added for the north bound interfaces for LACP:

- `show lacp system-priority` should show the default global priority used on the box.
- `show lacp port-channel` should display information about portchannel name, interval, mode, priority for all portchannels
- `show lacp interface port-channel < port-channel id >` should display the above mentioned information for the specified port-channel.
